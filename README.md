# SOLID_Design_Principle
SOLID is one of the most popular sets of design principles in object-oriented software development. 
It’s a mnemonic acronym for the following five design principles:      
1. <b>Single Responsibility Principle.</b><br/>
    <i>A class/entity should have one, and only one, reason to change.</i>
2. <b>Open/Closed Principle.</b><br/>
    <i>Entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.</i>
3. <b>Liskov Substitution Principle.</b> <br/> 
    <i>Subclass/derived class should be substitutable for their base/parent class.</i>
4. <b>Interface Segregation Principle.</b><br/>
    <i>A Client should not be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use.</i>
5. <b>Dependency Inversion.</b><br/>
    <i>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.</i>

<br/>
Here is the very basic implementation of SOLID Design Principle using Java.
